Description of process to get NLDAS data 
Overall, you make a list of URLS that will download all of your data. Then you tell the computer to go to those urls and download everything. Then you put it in a long data format that you can save as a csv. 
Step-by-step Instructions
0) create an account at https://daac.gsfc.nasa.gov/ 
You will need the user name and password to download the data
1) create a folder in the project directory called nldas_YYYY 
where YYYY = 2014, 2009, etc 
2) Go to https://daac.gsfc.nasa.gov/
/// search for "NLDAS_FORA0125_H_002" in the GES DISC data collections search area 
Make sure you are looking at hourly data
3) click on "subset/ Get Data" it is a blue text under "NLDAS Primary Forcing Data L4 Hourly 0.125 x 0.125 degree V002 (NLDAS_FORA0125_H.002)"
4) Choose the dates, area, and variables you want. The area I used for NY was:
 -80.1, 40.00, -71.8, 45.4
It is helpful to choose just 2 days at first, to make sure everything is running smoothly. 
5) Choose the grib data format 
6) Now click "Download Links List" 
This will download a plain text file. This plain text file is just a series of url's. 
Each url is an automatic download. If you pasted that url into your browser, you would just download the grib file for one hour. 
7) Now put that text file into the nldas_YYYY folder you just made. 
8) Now its time to open the terminal 
If you have a Mac for your terminal. For Windows, its pretty different and my instructions do not apply. 
The terminal is like a way to tell the computer to do stuff via typing, not clicking or using applications. Its parallel to going from phone texting to talking in person- you can't short cut with emojis, you have to say exactly what you think. 
9) The first thing you do is change your directory to the nldas_YYYY folder. 
use the command cd, as in cd [directory]    ex: cd ~/Desktop/nldas_2014 
10) now you tell the computer to go to each of the sites and download the data. 
use this line in the terminal 
wget --input-file=nldas_2014.txt  --content-disposition --user=EarthDataUserName --password=EarthDataPassword -nv &>download.log

wget is a special program that automates downloading stuff. Google "download wget" if it is not currently in your computer. 
11) wait a few hours. Maybe a day. You can check your progress by typing.
